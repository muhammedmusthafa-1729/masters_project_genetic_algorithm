# masters_project_genetic_algorithm

install numpy, CoolProp libraries - pip install <library name>

this is a code that optimizes a spirally wound tubular heat exchanger using genetic algorithm.

#Optimization for minimum weight for given inlet conditions and outlet
#Optimization parameters are Tube material, tube size, ST/do, SL/do, NT1, dNT, NL-  7 parameters 
#Enthalpy method from Barron, using cross flow local equations - Property variation in both streams with temperature is considered
#Constraints- pressure drop percentage, min bend diameter, pitch angle, min tube thickness etc
